# Katy Chadwell Portfolio

This is my professional portfolio repository.

When the user visits my page, they will see a navbar at the top that contains my name, links to the About Me and Work sections of the page. Clicking them will route to those pages. The navbar also contains a link to my downloadable resume. There is also a dropdown menu that contains my phone number, email address, and links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter. The user is then greeted by a jumbotron containing a welcome message that includes the current time as well as a button called "Learn More."

Upon clicking that button or of clicking _About_ in the Navbar will take the user to my About page that includes a photo as well as a brief biography. Clicking _Work_ in the Navbar will take the user to the Works page where they will find a carousel of some of my works. Each slide contains a photo, as well as links to the deployment and repository, and a brief description.

Finally, at the bottom of the page the user will find the footer which contains links to my phone number, email, GitHub and LinkedIn.
